## Practice Finding Bugs

We were given a "Broken App" with the following instructions: "You’ve just joined a team that is building a web app for a financial system, bankly.

You have a generally-nicely-written application and it even has tests, and all tests pass!

However, there are several bugs in the application — they’re just not things that are being tested for (so, in a sense, there are two bugs for each: the broken code, and the fact that there’s no test that caught it).

Some bugs relate to methods returning slightly-wrong information, or being too flexible in what they accept, or failing to check reasonable security requirements. 

read the docstrings for the routes carefully. Treat these as your “source of truth” for what the function is supposed to do."
